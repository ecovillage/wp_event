# Developer Documentation: CustomPostType

** WIP **

## Custom Post Types in WordPress (or how I understand them)

In WordPress, Custom Post Types (CPT) can be used to store and present data with (or even without) some structure.  One guy once noticed that WordPress was a blogging platform at its core.

For the people familiar with Rails or any similar MVCish web-application framework, CPTs can be thought of as your classes.

However, CPTs do not have attributes/fields of themselves (except some standard fields, like title, author etc.pp. of which most are optional, too).

Instead, like any other PostType (and to the beginnerish me everything in WordPress seems to be modelled as a PostType, sigh), MetaData can be attached to it.

## CustomPostType Mapping

Now comes the funny part.

## MetaData Mapping

It gets much funnier, still.
